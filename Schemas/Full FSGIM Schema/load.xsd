		<xs:documentation>The Load Component is the portion of the FSGIM that provides an abstract representation of all devices that consume electricity. This includes devices powered from the electrical grid, powered from an alternate source, or battery powered devices. Some loads can only be switched on and off. Other loads can be modified to manage peaks or in response to pricing or other grid interactions.

The Load Component contains classes that support the ability to forecast demand, energy consumption, or both.  It also contains classes that support some types of protection to prevent damage of physical equipment, however real devices may need additional safety constraints that are not captured in the model.</xs:documentation>

					<xs:element name="requestedCurtailmentLevel" type="FSGIMEventSignalType" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>This attribute defines the demand level the Energy Manager is requesting the load to operate.  The request by the Energy Manager is always a curtailment amount; however, the load will compare this curtailment requested amount to the present demand of the load and may then a) curtail it more, b) restore it more or c) leave the load at its present demand state.

The request is made in one of four ways defined by the value requestedCurtailmentLevel.signalType :

1)  When the requestedCurtailmentLevel.signalType attribute is set to 'setpoint', the requestedCurtailmentLevel.currentValue attribute describes the fixed amount of demand to which the load should operate. currentValue must be a positive number or zero. The currentValue is compared against the actualCurtailableAmount and maximumCurtailmentAmount to determine the curtailment or restoration needed to meet the request.  
a) If currentValue equals the actualCurtailedAmount, no further curtailment or restoration will occur. The curtailmentStatus will be set to curtailmentCompliant.
b)  If currentValue is less than the actualCurtailedAmount, then if the load has surpassed its minCurtailTime but has not yet reached the maxCurtailTime, the load will be considered for early release.  The load may be released in its entirety for a two-state load or partially for a multistate load until the actualCurtailedAmount reaches currentValue's value. If the load cannot be released to exactly match the request, the load will be released as close as possible as it can be released without exceeding the request. The curtailmentStatus will remain as curtailmentCompliant. 
c)  If currentValue is greater than the actualCurtailedAmount, the load may be further curtailed as possible upwards to the maximumCurtailmentAmount. The curtailmentStatus attribute will then be adjusted to reflect whether the curtailment is curtailmentCompliant or curtailmentNoncompliant.
d)  If currentValue is greater than the maximumCurtailableAmount, the load will be completely curtailed and the curtailmentStatus will be set to curtailmentNoncompliant.
Stated mathematically, 
assure
0 &lt;= currentValue &lt;= maximumCurtailmentAmount
And if
	currentValue &gt;= actualCurtailableAmount; amount to curtail = currentValue - actualCurtailableAmount
else if
	currentValue &lt; actualCurtailableAmount; amount to restore = actualCurtailableAmount - currentValue.


2) When the requestedCurtailmentLevel.signalType attribute is set to 'delta', the requestedCurtailmentLevel.currentValue attribute describes the relative amount of demand to which the load should be adjusted. currentValue may be a positive or negative number. The sum of currentValue and actualCurtailedAmount, is compared against zero and maximumCurtailmentAmount to determine if curtailment or restoration is needed to meet the request.
a) If the value of currentValue is zero no further curtailment or restoration will occur. The curtailmentStatus will be set to curtailmentCompliant.
b)  If currentValue is positive, the load will be further curtailed as possible upwards to the maximumCurtailmentAmount. If the sum of currentValue and actualCurtailedAmount is greater than maximumCurtailmentAmount, the load will be completely curtailed and the curtailmentStatus will be set to curtailmentNoncompliant otherwise it will be set to curtailment Compliant.
c)  If currentValue is negative, then if the load has surpassed its minCurtailTime but has not yet reached the maxCurtailTime, the load will be considered for early release.  The load may be released in its entirety for a two-state load or partially for a multistate load until the currentValue value is reached or actualCurtailableAmount is zero. If the sum of currentValue and actualCurtailedAmount is less than zero, the load will be completely released and the curtailmentStatus will be set to curtailmentNoncompliant otherwise it will be set to curtailment Compliant.
Stated mathematically, 
assure
0 &lt;= currentValue+ actualCurtailableAmount &lt;= maximumCurtailmentAmount
And if
	currentValue &gt;= 0, amount to curtail = currentValue
else if
	currentValue &lt; 0, amount to restore = currentValue.


3) When the requestedCurtailmentLevel.signalType attribute is set to 'multiplier', the requestedCurtailmentLevel.currentValue attribute divided by 100 describes the percentage of the maximumCurtailableAmount value to which the load should be adjusted. currentValue must be a positive number in the range of 0 to 100. The calculated value of product of currentValue/100 and maximumCurtailmentAmount is compared to the actualCurtailedAmount to determine the curtailment or restoration needed to meet the request.
a) If this calculated value is equal to actualCurtailedAmount, then no further curtailment or restoration will occur. The curtailmentStatus will be set to curtailmentCompliant.
b)  If this calculated value is less the actualCurtailedAmount, then if the load has surpassed its minCurtailTime but has not yet reached the maxCurtailTime the load will be considered for early release.  The load may be released in its entirety for a two-state load or partially for a multistate load until the actualCurtailedAmount reaches the calculated value.. The curtailmentStatus will remain as curtailmentCompliant.
c)  If the calculated value is greater than the actualCurtailedAmount, the load will be further curtailed as possible upwards to the maximumCurtailmentAmount. The curtailmentStatus attribute will then be adjusted to reflect whether the curtailment is curtailmentCompliant or curtailmentNoncompliant.
Stated mathematically, 
If
(currentValue/100)*maximumCurtailmentAmount &gt;= actualCurtailableAmount; amount to curtail = ((currentValue/100)*maximumCurtailmentAmount) - actualCurtailableAmount
else if
(currentValue/100)*maximumCurtailmentAmount &lt; actualCurtailableAmount; amount to release = actualCurtailableAmount-((currentValue/100)*maximumCurtailmentAmount) 

4)  When the requestedCurtailmentLevel.signalType attribute is set to 'level', requestedCurtailmentLevel.currentValue attribute describes the predefined level to which the load will be adjusted. currentValue must be a positive number within the range of 1 to n, where n is defined as the number of entries in the curtailmentRatingsLevel array. When the request is received, the load will adjust its curtailment to the level defined by curtailmentRatingsLevel(currentValue).curtailmentAmount
a) If curtailmentAmount equals the actualCurtailedAmount, no further curtailment or restoration will occur. The curtailmentStatus will be set to curtailmentCompliant.
b)  If curtailmentAmount is less than the actualCurtailedAmount, then if the load has surpassed its minCurtailTime but has not yet reached the maxCurtailTime, the load will be considered for early release.  The load may be released in its entirety for a two-state load or partially for a multistate load until the actualCurtailedAmount reaches curtailmentAmount's value. The curtailmentStatus will remain as curtailmentCompliant. 
c)  If curtailmentAmount is greater than the actualCurtailedAmount, the load may be further curtailed as possible upwards to the maximumCurtailmentAmount. The curtailmentStatus attribute will then be adjusted to reflect whether the curtailment is curtailmentCompliant or curtailmentNoncompliant.
Stated mathematically, 
if
curtailmentRatingsLevel(currentValue).curtailmentAmount &gt;= actualCurtailableAmount; amount to curtail = curtailmentRatingsLevel(currentValue). - actualCurtailableAmount
else if
curtailmentRatingsLevel(currentValue).curtailmentAmount &lt; actualCurtailableAmount; amount to release = actualCurtailableAmount -curtailmentRatingsLevel(currentValue). 

NOTE:  A load that may be curtailed multiple times can be curtailed only when in the eligible, minCurtailQueue or maxCurtailQueue states. Upon additional curtailments, the curtailment timers may or may not be reset as a local matter.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:documentation>The PowerRampSegmentType data structure is used to define a single array element of the recoveryRamp and stagingRamp array of the Load class. Each array element defines the beginning demand for the line segment and the rate of rise or drop. These attributes combined with the duration completely forms a line segment defining a portion of the ramp.</xs:documentation>

As an example, a multistate fan may only use a portion of the ramp, as it sequences from low to medium to high speed levels (false); whereas, a production line, once started, may need to run through its complete set of ramp segments (true). If the attribute is not defined it is assumed to be false.</xs:documentation>
