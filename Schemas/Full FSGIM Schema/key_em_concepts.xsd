	<xs:annotation>
		<xs:documentation>This clause covers the portion of the FSGIM that provides information elements supporting the key roles of managing, monitoring, and reporting the energy aspects of all or some portion of a facility, including interfacing within a hierarchy of energy managers. It ties together present measurement and control with forecasts of future needs and historical records of past performance. Some energy managers interface with entities outside of the facility to exchange information including weather, emissions, energy pricing and cost, and energy demand and supply.</xs:documentation>
