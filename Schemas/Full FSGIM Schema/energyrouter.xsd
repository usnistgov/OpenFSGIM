		<xs:documentation>The EnergyRouter concept is used to handle situations where loads can receive power from more than one source.  When this occurs, the Energy Manager Component must be able to determine which power source or combination of power sources are driving the loads in order for it to properly make energy management decisions.  Examples of where this might occur include loads that can be powered by the grid or a backup generator, switchgear capable of selecting between two utility feeds, configurations that allow photovoltaic arrays to supplement power from the grid, or configurations that allow photovoltaic arrays to send excess power to the grid.  Specializations of the EnergyRouter are provided to handle each of these scenarios by providing the Energy Manager Component with the knowledge that it needs in order to determine the resulting power flows.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:documentation>This class is used to model bidirectional combiner boxes, which are devices that allow two sources of energy to be connected to one or more loads in a way that allows energy to flow from the onsite generation source to the utility grid but not from the utility grid to the onsite generation source.  The effect of the constraints that are placed on this class results in the following behavior for the bidirectional combiner box:
	- If the amount of power available from the onsite generation side of the combiner box is less than the amount of power consumed by the equipment connected to load side of the combiner box, then the amount of power drawn from utility grid side of combiner box is the difference between the amount of power drawn from load side of the combiner box and the amount of power injected into the onsite generation side of the combiner box. 
	- If the amount of power available from the onsite generation side of the combiner box is greater than the amount of power consumed by the equipment connected to load side of the combiner box, then the amount of power sent back to the grid is the amount of power available from the onsite generation side of the combiner box minus the amount of power drawn from load side of the combiner box.</xs:documentation>
