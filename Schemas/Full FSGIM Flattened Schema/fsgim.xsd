		<xs:documentation>The Energy Manager Component is the portion of the FSGIM that provides an abstract representation of energy management system functionality. The functionality may be implemented in any device that performs analysis and/or makes energy-related decisions involving meters, loads, generators, or energy storage devices.  The Energy Manager Component includes a representation of information used to make these decisions, including cost, emissions, and other information. The Energy Manager Component also supports tracking historical energy data, projecting future energy demand, and interfacing to third party sources of energy related information such as weather. 

An energy manager fulfills two roles in a facility:

	1. Managing/monitoring the energy aspects of some portion of a facility and
	2. interfacing with entities outside a facility.


An energy manager that only fulfills the first role is called a "local energy manager" or "local EM." An energy manager that interfaces outside of the facility, regardless of any local energy management functions, is called an "energy services interface energy manager" or "ESI EM."</xs:documentation>

			<xs:documentation>This class represents net demand reductions resulting from supply increases. The class supports power ramps that describe the power profile for a generation resource when it is energized (stagingRamps) or de-energized (recoveryRamps). 

For each array element of a generation stagingRamp, the stagingRamp[n].rate defines the amount of power increase and the stagingRamp[n].duration defines the length of time in seconds upon which this increase is in effect. If the stagingRamp[n].beginRamp is defined for a ramp segment, this is the initial value of the ramp segment; if it is not present the initial value of the ramp equals the ending value of the previous ramp segment. Although the generation stagingRamp attribute name implies that the demand is monotonically increasing, individual array elements may have slopes less than, greater than, or equal to 0. However, the overall trend of the function shall be increasing.

For each array element of a generator recoveryRamp, the recoveryRamp[n].rate defines the amount of power decrease and the recoveryRamp[n].duration defines the length of time in seconds upon which this decrease is in effect. If the recoveryRamp[n].beginRamp is defined for a ramp segment, this is the initial value of the ramp segment; if it is not present the initial value of the ramp equals the ending value of the previous ramp segment.

		<xs:documentation>Facilities will need to record and report total values for energy related quantities such as energy used, net demand, or emissions. Facility managers will want to identify and manage collections of entities within the facility that contribute to these total values.  

There are three major concepts involved:
	- Collection – a set of entities that is identified as a group because the members share some trait;
	- Ruleset – an expression of directives and constraints used to filter a Collection or derive an aggregated value; and
	- Aggregation – a value derived by combining several other values according to a Ruleset.

Some examples of Collections and Aggregations include:
	- At the facility level: total demand for all of the equipment in the facility;
	- At the building level: the energy output from the photovoltaic arrays for the day; and
	- At the floor level: total energy used by loads on the fourth floor during the month.</xs:documentation>

					<xs:documentation>A value from a register which represents the bulk quantity of a commodity. This quantity is computed as the integral of the commodity usage rate. This value is typically used as the basis for the dial reading at the meter, and as a result, will roll over upon reaching a maximum dial value. 
Note 1: With the metering system, the roll-over behavior typically implies a roll-under behavior so that the value presented is always a positive value (e.g., unsigned integer or positive decimal.) However, when communicating data between enterprise applications a negative value might occur in a case such as net metering.
Note 2: A BulkQuantity refers primarily to the dial reading and not the consumption over a specific period of time.</xs:documentation>

				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>The sum of the previous billing period values. Note: "Cumulative" is commonly used in conjunction with "demand." Each demand reset causes the maximum demand value for the present billing period (since the last demand reset) to accumulate as an accumulative total of all maximum demands. So instead of "zeroing" the demand register, a demand reset has the affect of adding the present maximum demand to this accumulating total. </xs:documentation>

				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>When this description is applied to a metered value, it implies that the value is a time-independent cumulative quantity much a BulkQuantity, except that it latches upon the maximum value upon reaching that value. Any additional accumulation (positive or negative) is discarded until a reset occurs. 
Note: A LatchingQuantity may also occur in the downward direction – upon reaching a minimum value. The terms "maximum" or "minimum" will usually be included as an attribute when this type of accumulation behaviour is present.
When this description is applied to an encoded value (UOM= "Code"), it implies that the value has one or more bits which are latching. The condition that caused the bit to be set may have long since evaporated.
In either case, the timestamp that accompanies the value may not coincide with the moment the value was initially set.
In both cases a system will need to perform an operation to clear the latched value.</xs:documentation>

Likewise, when the negative bound is reached, any additional negative accumulation is discarded, but positive accumulation is accepted (thus increasing the counter.) </xs:documentation>

Note 1: When used to describe VA, "lagging" describes a form of measurement where reactive power is considered in all four quadrants, but real power is considered only in quadrants I and IV.
Note 2: When used to describe power factor, the term "lagging" implies that the PF is negative. The term "lagging" in this case takes the place of the negative sign. If a signed PF value is to be passed by the data producer, then the direction of flow enumeration zero (none) should be used in order to avoid the possibility of creating an expression that employs a double negative. The data consumer should be able to tell from the sign of the data if the PF is leading or lagging. This principle is analogous to the concept that "Reverse" energy is an implied negative value, and to publish a negative reverse value would be ambiguous.

		<xs:annotation>
			<xs:documentation>Time attribute inherent or fundamental to the reading value (as opposed to 'macroPeriod' that supplies an "adjective" to describe aspects of a time period with regard to the measurement). It refers to the way the value was originally measured and not to the frequency at which it is reported or presented. For example, an hourly interval of consumption data would have value 'hourly' as an attribute. However in the case of an hourly sampled voltage value, the meterReadings schema would carry the 'hourly' interval size information.

It is common for meters to report demand in a form that is measured over the course of a portion of an hour, while enterprise applications however commonly assume the demand (in kW or kVAr) normalized to 1 hour. The system that receives readings directly from the meter therefore performs this transformation before publishing readings for use by the other enterprise systems. The scalar used is chosen based on the block size (not any sub-interval size).</xs:documentation>

For example, 'energy' with a unit of measure of 'kWh' indicates to the user that active energy is being measured, while with 'kVAh' or 'kVArh', it indicates apparent energy and reactive energy, respectively. 'power' can be combined in a similar way with various power units of measure: Distortion power ('distortionVoltAmperes') with 'kVA' is different from 'power' with 'kVA'.</xs:documentation>

				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>Time attribute inherent or fundamental to the reading value (as opposed to 'macroPeriod' that supplies an "adjective" to describe aspects of a time period with regard to the measurement). It refers to the way the value was originally measured and not to the frequency at which it is reported or presented. For example, an hourly interval of consumption data would have value 'hourly' as an attribute. However in the case of an hourly sampled voltage value, the meterReadings schema would carry the 'hourly' interval size information.
It is common for meters to report demand in a form that is measured over the course of a portion of an hour, while enterprise applications however commonly assume the demand (in kW or kVAr) normalised to 1 hour. The sytem that receives readings directly from the meter therefore must perform this transformation before publishing readings for use by the other enterprise systems. The scalar used is chosen based on the block size (not any sub-interval size).</xs:documentation>

					<xs:element name="requestedSupplyLevel" type="FSGIMEventSignalType" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>This attribute defines the power level to which the Energy Manager is requesting the generator to operate.  The request by the Energy Manager is always a supply amount; however, the generator will compare this supply requested amount to the present supply of the generator and may then a) supply more power, b) reduce the power or c) leave the generator at its present supply state.

The request is made in one of four ways defined by the value requestedSupplyLevel.signalType :

1)  When the requestedSupplyLevel.signalType attribute is set to 'setpoint', the requestedSupplyLevel.currentValue attribute describes the absolute amount of supply the generator may deliver. The currentValue must be a positive number or zero. The currentValue is compared against
the generatedSupplySetpoint and maximumSupply to determine the adjustment needed to the generation supply setpoint.  
a) If the currentValue equals the generatedSupplySetpoint, no further adjustment will occur. The supplyStatus will be set to supplyCompliant.
b)  If the currentValue is zero, the generator will be powered down if the generator has surpassed its minSupplyTime and the supplyStatus will be set to supplyCompliant. If the minSupplyTime has not yet been surpassed, the generator will be powered down as soon as it reaches the minSupplyTime. The supplyStatus will be set to minSupplyQueue until the minSupplyTime is reached where upon the supplyStatus will then be set to supplyCompliant.
c)  If the currentValue is less than the generatedSupplySetpoint but not zero, the generator setpoint will be reduced if the generator has surpassed its minSupplyTime. If not, the generator will reduce the power setpoint as soon as it reaches the minSupplyTime. The supplyStatus will be set to supplyCompliant.
d)  If the currentValue is greater than the generatedSupplySetpoint but less than the maximumSupply, the generator setpoint will be increased if the generator has surpassed its minSupplyTime.  If not, the generator setpoint will be increased once the generator reaches the minSupplyTime.
e)  If the currentValue is greater than  the maximumSupply, the generator setpoint will be increased to the maximumSupply and the supplyStatus will be set to supplyNoncompliant

2) When the requestedSupplyLevel.signalType attribute is set to 'delta', the requestedSupplyLevel.currentValue attribute defines the relative amount of supply the generator may deliver. The currentValue may be a positive or negative number. The sum of currentValue and actualGeneratedSupply, is compared against zero and maximumSupply to determine the adjustment needed to the generation supply setpoint.  
a) If the currentValue is zero no further curtailment or restoration will occur. The supplyStatus will be set to supplyCompliant.
b)  If the currentValue is positive, the generatedSupplySetpoint will be increased to the sum of the currentValue plus the generatedSupplySetpoint, but not to exceed the maximumSupply. If the sum of the currentValue and the generatedSupplySetpoint is less than the maximumSupply the supplyStatus will be set to supplyCompliant.  . If the sum of the currentValue and the generatedSupplySetpoint is greater than the maxSupply the supplyStatus will be set to supplyNonCompliant.  
c)  If the currentValue is negative, the generatedSupplySetpoint will be decreased to the sum of the currentValue plus the generatedSupplySetpoint, but not less than zero. If the sum of the currentValue and the generatedSupplySetpoint is greater than zero, the supplyStatus will be set to supplyCompliant.  If the sum of the currentValue and the generatedSupplySetpoint is less than zero, generatedSupplySetpoint will be set to zero and the supplyStatus will be set to supplyCompliant.  

3) When the requestedSupplyLevel.signalType attribute is set to 'multiplier', the requestedSupplyLevel.currentValue attribute divided by 100 defines the percentage of the generatedSupplySetpoint value to which the generator should be adjusted. That is:

generatedSupplySetpoint &lt;= generatedSupplySetpoint*(currentValue/100)

where the currentValue must be a positive number in the range of 0 to 100.  The supplyStatus will be set to supplyCompliant.  


4)  When the requestedSupplyLevel.signalType attribute is set to 'level', the requestedSupplyLevel.currentValue attribute describes the predefined level to which the generator will be adjusted. The currentValue must be a positive number within the range of 1 to n, where n is defined as the number of entries in the supplyRatingsLevel array. When the request is received, the generator will adjust its generatedSupplySetpoint to the level defined by supplyRatingsLevel(currentValue).supplyAmount.

If the value of currentValue is not within the range of n supported by the generator, the request will not be honored.</xs:documentation>

		<xs:documentation>The Load Component is the portion of the FSGIM that provides an abstract representation of all devices that consume electricity. This includes devices powered from the electrical grid, powered from an alternate source, or battery powered devices. Some loads can only be switched on and off. Other loads can be modified to manage peaks or in response to pricing or other grid interactions.

The Load Component contains classes that support the ability to forecast demand, energy consumption, or both.  It also contains classes that support some types of protection to prevent damage of physical equipment, however real devices may need additional safety constraints that are not captured in the model.</xs:documentation>

					<xs:element name="requestedCurtailmentLevel" type="FSGIMEventSignalType" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>This attribute defines the demand level the Energy Manager is requesting the load to operate.  The request by the Energy Manager is always a curtailment amount; however, the load will compare this curtailment requested amount to the present demand of the load and may then a) curtail it more, b) restore it more or c) leave the load at its present demand state.

The request is made in one of four ways defined by the value requestedCurtailmentLevel.signalType :

1)  When the requestedCurtailmentLevel.signalType attribute is set to 'setpoint', the requestedCurtailmentLevel.currentValue attribute describes the fixed amount of demand to which the load should operate. currentValue must be a positive number or zero. The currentValue is compared against the actualCurtailableAmount and maximumCurtailmentAmount to determine the curtailment or restoration needed to meet the request.  
a) If currentValue equals the actualCurtailedAmount, no further curtailment or restoration will occur. The curtailmentStatus will be set to curtailmentCompliant.
b)  If currentValue is less than the actualCurtailedAmount, then if the load has surpassed its minCurtailTime but has not yet reached the maxCurtailTime, the load will be considered for early release.  The load may be released in its entirety for a two-state load or partially for a multistate load until the actualCurtailedAmount reaches currentValue's value. If the load cannot be released to exactly match the request, the load will be released as close as possible as it can be released without exceeding the request. The curtailmentStatus will remain as curtailmentCompliant. 
c)  If currentValue is greater than the actualCurtailedAmount, the load may be further curtailed as possible upwards to the maximumCurtailmentAmount. The curtailmentStatus attribute will then be adjusted to reflect whether the curtailment is curtailmentCompliant or curtailmentNoncompliant.
d)  If currentValue is greater than the maximumCurtailableAmount, the load will be completely curtailed and the curtailmentStatus will be set to curtailmentNoncompliant.
Stated mathematically, 
assure
0 &lt;= currentValue &lt;= maximumCurtailmentAmount
And if
	currentValue &gt;= actualCurtailableAmount; amount to curtail = currentValue - actualCurtailableAmount
else if
	currentValue &lt; actualCurtailableAmount; amount to restore = actualCurtailableAmount - currentValue.


2) When the requestedCurtailmentLevel.signalType attribute is set to 'delta', the requestedCurtailmentLevel.currentValue attribute describes the relative amount of demand to which the load should be adjusted. currentValue may be a positive or negative number. The sum of currentValue and actualCurtailedAmount, is compared against zero and maximumCurtailmentAmount to determine if curtailment or restoration is needed to meet the request.
a) If the value of currentValue is zero no further curtailment or restoration will occur. The curtailmentStatus will be set to curtailmentCompliant.
b)  If currentValue is positive, the load will be further curtailed as possible upwards to the maximumCurtailmentAmount. If the sum of currentValue and actualCurtailedAmount is greater than maximumCurtailmentAmount, the load will be completely curtailed and the curtailmentStatus will be set to curtailmentNoncompliant otherwise it will be set to curtailment Compliant.
c)  If currentValue is negative, then if the load has surpassed its minCurtailTime but has not yet reached the maxCurtailTime, the load will be considered for early release.  The load may be released in its entirety for a two-state load or partially for a multistate load until the currentValue value is reached or actualCurtailableAmount is zero. If the sum of currentValue and actualCurtailedAmount is less than zero, the load will be completely released and the curtailmentStatus will be set to curtailmentNoncompliant otherwise it will be set to curtailment Compliant.
Stated mathematically, 
assure
0 &lt;= currentValue+ actualCurtailableAmount &lt;= maximumCurtailmentAmount
And if
	currentValue &gt;= 0, amount to curtail = currentValue
else if
	currentValue &lt; 0, amount to restore = currentValue.


3) When the requestedCurtailmentLevel.signalType attribute is set to 'multiplier', the requestedCurtailmentLevel.currentValue attribute divided by 100 describes the percentage of the maximumCurtailableAmount value to which the load should be adjusted. currentValue must be a positive number in the range of 0 to 100. The calculated value of product of currentValue/100 and maximumCurtailmentAmount is compared to the actualCurtailedAmount to determine the curtailment or restoration needed to meet the request.
a) If this calculated value is equal to actualCurtailedAmount, then no further curtailment or restoration will occur. The curtailmentStatus will be set to curtailmentCompliant.
b)  If this calculated value is less the actualCurtailedAmount, then if the load has surpassed its minCurtailTime but has not yet reached the maxCurtailTime the load will be considered for early release.  The load may be released in its entirety for a two-state load or partially for a multistate load until the actualCurtailedAmount reaches the calculated value.. The curtailmentStatus will remain as curtailmentCompliant.
c)  If the calculated value is greater than the actualCurtailedAmount, the load will be further curtailed as possible upwards to the maximumCurtailmentAmount. The curtailmentStatus attribute will then be adjusted to reflect whether the curtailment is curtailmentCompliant or curtailmentNoncompliant.
Stated mathematically, 
If
(currentValue/100)*maximumCurtailmentAmount &gt;= actualCurtailableAmount; amount to curtail = ((currentValue/100)*maximumCurtailmentAmount) - actualCurtailableAmount
else if
(currentValue/100)*maximumCurtailmentAmount &lt; actualCurtailableAmount; amount to release = actualCurtailableAmount-((currentValue/100)*maximumCurtailmentAmount) 

4)  When the requestedCurtailmentLevel.signalType attribute is set to 'level', requestedCurtailmentLevel.currentValue attribute describes the predefined level to which the load will be adjusted. currentValue must be a positive number within the range of 1 to n, where n is defined as the number of entries in the curtailmentRatingsLevel array. When the request is received, the load will adjust its curtailment to the level defined by curtailmentRatingsLevel(currentValue).curtailmentAmount
a) If curtailmentAmount equals the actualCurtailedAmount, no further curtailment or restoration will occur. The curtailmentStatus will be set to curtailmentCompliant.
b)  If curtailmentAmount is less than the actualCurtailedAmount, then if the load has surpassed its minCurtailTime but has not yet reached the maxCurtailTime, the load will be considered for early release.  The load may be released in its entirety for a two-state load or partially for a multistate load until the actualCurtailedAmount reaches curtailmentAmount's value. The curtailmentStatus will remain as curtailmentCompliant. 
c)  If curtailmentAmount is greater than the actualCurtailedAmount, the load may be further curtailed as possible upwards to the maximumCurtailmentAmount. The curtailmentStatus attribute will then be adjusted to reflect whether the curtailment is curtailmentCompliant or curtailmentNoncompliant.
Stated mathematically, 
if
curtailmentRatingsLevel(currentValue).curtailmentAmount &gt;= actualCurtailableAmount; amount to curtail = curtailmentRatingsLevel(currentValue). - actualCurtailableAmount
else if
curtailmentRatingsLevel(currentValue).curtailmentAmount &lt; actualCurtailableAmount; amount to release = actualCurtailableAmount -curtailmentRatingsLevel(currentValue). 

NOTE:  A load that may be curtailed multiple times can be curtailed only when in the eligible, minCurtailQueue or maxCurtailQueue states. Upon additional curtailments, the curtailment timers may or may not be reset as a local matter.</xs:documentation>

When a curtailable load is partially curtailed (less than the maximumCurtailableDemand) and curtailment is reduced, the power will increase starting at n-th recoveryRamp of the sum from 0 to n of the upRamp[n].rate that is closest to the actualCurtailedDemand.</xs:documentation>

Use of the Standard Aggregations requires a logical tree structure for Energy Managers consistent with the structure of the circuits in the facility. In order to get a Standard Aggregation that correctly represents an entire Circuit, the designer must ensure that there is one Energy Manager with direct or indirect visibility of all contributors to that Circuit.

For quantities to be suitable for standard aggregations, they must have consistent values for their measurement time reference, meaning the measurements must have the same start times and durations.  When it is not practical to precisely align time references, it is a local matter to decide how to adapt actual measurement values to make them consistent.

The standard rulesets are written from the perspective of present data. When applying the ruleset to historical or forecast data, substitutions of attributes from the EMIntervalData Class instead of the EMPresentData Class are required. 

For example, the DemandRuleset refers to 
“EM.presentAggregationData.aggregationMetadata.hasElectricalGenerators.” 
For a historical sequence, this is replaced by
“EM.billingCycle.intervals.attach.aggregationMetadata.hasElectricalGenerators.”</xs:documentation>

			<xs:documentation>For historical aggregations, this is the aggregate demand of loads directly or indirectly managed by the associated EM averaged over the identified time interval assuming the largest acceptable response to demand response events occurred.

For a partially completed (filling) demand interval, this is the expected demand of loads directly or indirectly managed by the associated EM as if the largest acceptable response to a demand response event was in effect, averaged over the time since the beginning of the present demand interval.

The exact manner in which a forecast aggregation is determined is a local matter.  It shall represent the expected aggregate demand of loads, with the largest acceptable demand response, directly or indirectly managed by the associated EM averaged over the identified time interval.

For example, in a production line this could be the demand of the production line when it was providing the largest acceptable demand reduction in response to a DR request. For an HVAC system, this could be the demand that still meets code requirements and acceptable comfort conditions assuming a certain set of weather conditions and occupancy levels.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:element name="powerCurves" type="PowerCurve" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>This attribute defines one or more piecewise linear curves mapping the percentage of power consumed by the device as a function of the present level of operation of the device.  Many loads draw power (or generators supply power) based on the present loading characteristics of the device. For example, a motor driving a fan will draw more power as the fan blade pitch is increased.

The axes of the curve are defined in percent to allow loads of any type to utilize the attribute.  For example a simple 60W incandescent light bulb would likely be modeled by a linear segment (0,0), (100,100). Here as the bulb is energized (dimmed) from off (0%) to fully on (100%), the power needed to  energize the device also travels from 0% to 100%.  A more complicated device such as a room air-conditioner may have a non-linear power curve. Here, as the coolness setting is adjusted from warmest to coolest, the air conditioner will draw relative more power when set to maximum cooling than when set to minimum cooling. 

When powerCurve is not present, the load or generator is assumed to be a two state device drawing no power when the device is off and adjustedNoDRPower when the device is on. When adjustedNoDRPower also is not present, the load or generator is assumed to be a two state device drawing no power when the device is off and maximumRealPower when the device is on.</xs:documentation>

	<xs:annotation>
		<xs:documentation>This package contains enumerations used in FSGIM. There are two kinds of enumerations -- simple and Code List. A simple enumeration is a set of strings and descriptions that represent a set of values for the enumeration. An attribute that has the type of the enumeration can be expected to "have" a single value from the list. Code Lists are enumerations that have both string and numeric values. In this case the semantic value is a tuple -- string and code.

The representations of enumerations in communications protocols is a local matter and typically highly specific to the standard encoding it. Therefore, FSGIM code lists do not have a data type. The implementing standards choose whether to encode the enumerated value (string or numeric) and what transport data representation to use.</xs:documentation>
	</xs:annotation>
	<xs:simpleType name="CurrencyKind">
		<xs:annotation>
			<xs:documentation>Currency is represented in FSGIM as an enumeration. The use of this is optional so it can be omitted when an actual currency is not known. The enumeration is based on ISO 4217 three character codes and the FSIM model contains a snapshot of this list. Any implementation can extend this list as needed but must unambiguously identify how extensions are separate from the ISO standard set.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:documentation>This identifies the units of measure based on the NIST Special Publication 811 2008 edition -- Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI). Note that these reference document supports SI units as well as common units of measurements in practice including CGS units.

Only VA, W, var, VAh, Wh, varh, Btu, J, therm, BtuPerh, g, gPerM3, gPerS, m, mPerS, WPerM2, rad, sb, pa, and degK are normative for the FSGIM standard.  The enumerated values of VA, W, var, VAh, Wh, and varh were changed from their original NAESB values of vA, w, vAr, vAH, wH, and vArH to make them consistent with the standard SI abbreviations for these units.  The enumerated values of Btu and BtuPerh were changed from their original NAESB values of btu and btuPerH to make them consistent with the standard abbreviations for British thermal units and hours.

Note:  The abbreviation MBtu is often used to represent thousands of Btu's (where M represents the Roman numeral for 1000).  The FSGIM always uses the SI prefixes listed in the SiScaleCodeType enumeration and not the prefixes based on Roman numerals.  This means that 1000 Btu's would be represented in the FSGIM as EnergyThermalQuantity.quantity = 1, EnergyThermalType.itemUnits = Btu, and EnergyThermalType.siScaleCode = k, not EnergyThermalType.siScaleCode = M.</xs:documentation>

		<xs:documentation>The EnergyRouter concept is used to handle situations where loads can receive power from more than one source.  When this occurs, the Energy Manager Component must be able to determine which power source or combination of power sources are driving the loads in order for it to properly make energy management decisions.  Examples of where this might occur include loads that can be powered by the grid or a backup generator, switchgear capable of selecting between two utility feeds, configurations that allow photovoltaic arrays to supplement power from the grid, or configurations that allow photovoltaic arrays to send excess power to the grid.  Specializations of the EnergyRouter are provided to handle each of these scenarios by providing the Energy Manager Component with the knowledge that it needs in order to determine the resulting power flows.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:documentation>This class is used to model bidirectional combiner boxes, which are devices that allow two sources of energy to be connected to one or more loads in a way that allows energy to flow from the onsite generation source to the utility grid but not from the utility grid to the onsite generation source.  The effect of the constraints that are placed on this class results in the following behavior for the bidirectional combiner box:
	- If the amount of power available from the onsite generation side of the combiner box is less than the amount of power consumed by the equipment connected to load side of the combiner box, then the amount of power drawn from utility grid side of combiner box is the difference between the amount of power drawn from load side of the combiner box and the amount of power injected into the onsite generation side of the combiner box. 
	- If the amount of power available from the onsite generation side of the combiner box is greater than the amount of power consumed by the equipment connected to load side of the combiner box, then the amount of power sent back to the grid is the amount of power available from the onsite generation side of the combiner box minus the amount of power drawn from load side of the combiner box.</xs:documentation>

	- If the amount of power available from the onsite generation side of the combiner box is less than the amount of power consumed by the equipment connected to load side of the combiner box, then the amount of power drawn from utility grid side of the combiner box  is the difference between the amount of power drawn from load side of the combiner box and the amount of power injected into the onsite generation side of the combiner box. 
	- If the amount of power available from the onsite generation side of the combiner box is greater than the amount of power consumed by the equipment connected to load side of the combiner box , then the amount of power drawn from utility grid side of the combiner box is zero and the amount of power actually injected into the onsite generation side of the combiner box  is equal to the amount of power drawn from load side of the combiner box.</xs:documentation>

	- nominal measurements, such as those that would appear on a product datasheet,
	- estimated measurements, such as those that would be created when trying to predict day-ahead demand, or
	- derived measurements, such as emissions measurements derived from power or energy measurements.

		<xs:documentation>Not explicitly defined in the standard. We define subtypes for ObjectReference type (which is just a string), so as to allow for validation per type of element. This is useful when there is no detailed LN/CDC/FCDA/DA model, and when an application receives only strings as references from the underlying MMS stack - it allows easy building of the meta-model objects.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:documentation>part 7-2, sec. 5
Instances of classes in the hierarchical information model (ACSI class hierarchy of logical device, logical node, data, data attributes) shall be constructed by the concatenation of all instance names comprising the whole path-name of an instance of a class that identifies the instance uniquely. The ObjectReference syntax shall be: LDName/LNName[.Name[. ...]].
The "/" shall separate the instance name of a logical device (LDName) from the name of an instance of a logical node (LNName). The "." shall separate the further names in the hierarchy. The "[  ]" shall indicate an option. The inner square bracket "[. ...]" shall indicate further names of nested definitions.
NOTE: Section 19 specifies constraints on the use of the type ObjectReference.
Modelling notes:
	- We define this type as abstract class and extend it with the subtypes which carry semantics of the above naming scheme.
	- Subtypes of ObjectReference provide methods that return separately all the elements that make the reference (e.g., FC, LDName, LNName), which have been parsed from the reference string.</xs:documentation>
